# calculator
In this project i will be bringing together everything I have learned in foundations. From CSS, HTML and Javascript, I will be putting my knowledge to the the test. Problem-solving by this point has become a passion. I look forward to the next challenge, and know that after any confusion or frustration will indeed come a breakthrough. I have learned that there is always a solution out there, i just need to find the right path and find an appropriate perspective and the answers will come with time and research. 

I have a vision for this calculator to be both visually pleasing, intuitive for the user to operate and of course accuracy in performing calculations. 

Edit:1 
First I will start with creating the basic functions of addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.
